Task 1: Population Visualization using Iris Dataset

This project visualizes the distribution of categorical and continuous variables from the Iris dataset using a bar chart and histogram.

 Description

For this task, I created visualizations that represent the distribution of various features in the Iris dataset:
- *Histogram - to show the distribution of the continuous variable - sepal_length.
- *Bar chart - to visualize the distribution of the categorical variable - species.

The Iris dataset contains measurements for different species of iris flowers, including variables like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The visualizations help in understanding how these features are distributed across the dataset.

Installation

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:


pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn


Usage

Once the required libraries are installed, you can run the Python script to generate the visualizations:

"python task_1_population_visualization.py"

The script will display:
1. A histogram showing the distribution of `sepal_length` (continuous variable).
2. A bar chart showing the count of each species in the dataset (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`).

Dataset

This project uses the Iris dataset, which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris).

#Results

- The histogram of `sepal_length` shows how the sepal length is distributed across different flowers in the dataset.
- The bar chart represents the count of each species in the Iris dataset, providing insight into the distribution of different species.
